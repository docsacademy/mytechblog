# Creating Interactive Images with Hotspots

Hotspots transform static images into interactive experiences by adding clickable areas that reveal additional information, trigger actions, or highlight specific features. This approach increases user engagement in educational content, product showcases, interactive maps, and many other use cases.

## What Are Hotspots?

Hotspots are interactive areas placed on an image. When users click or hover over these areas, they can see text explanations, multimedia content, links, or visual highlights. This allows you to present layered information that users can explore at their own pace.

A hotspot often appears as an icon, button, or highlighted region. When activated, it can:

- Display text in tooltips or popups  
- Show videos or images  
- Redirect users to another page  
- Highlight a specific part of the image with descriptive content  

By using hotspots, you can avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once and instead guide them to focus on what matters most.

## Use Cases

Interactive images with hotspots can be useful in many fields:

**Education** <br />
Create visual tutorials with step-by-step explanations.

**E-commerce** <br />
Highlight product features and specifications directly on product images.

**Infographics** <br />
Add depth by allowing users to explore additional data points.

**Maps and location content** <br />
Mark points of interest with contextual information.

**Team presentations** <br />
Make group photos interactive by linking team members to short bios.

**Technical documentation** <br />
Explain interface elements or workflows directly on software UI images.

1. **Upload or capture an image**: Start with a high-quality image.
